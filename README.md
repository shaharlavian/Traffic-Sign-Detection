# Traffic-Sign-Detection
## 1. Project Overview:
This project involves detecting traffic signs in images using a deep learning model. Traffic sign detection is crucial in autonomous driving and other applications where real-time recognition of road signs can improve safety and decision-making.
The model used for detection is YOLOv8 (You Only Look Once), a state-of-the-art object detection algorithm known for its accuracy and real-time performance.
## 2. Dataset:
The dataset used for this project is taken from Kaggle, a well-known platform for datasets and data science competitions.
The dataset contains labeled images of various traffic signs. Each image has bounding boxes indicating the location of the signs and labels specifying the type of sign (e.g., stop sign, speed limit, etc.).
The data is divided into training, validation, and test sets to properly evaluate model performance.
## 3. Model Used:
YOLOv8 (You Only Look Once version 8) was selected for this project due to its balance between speed and accuracy.
YOLO is known for predicting both the bounding boxes and class labels of objects in a single forward pass of the network, making it highly efficient for real-time detection tasks.
The model was trained on the traffic sign dataset, where it learned to detect and classify various traffic signs.
## 4. Steps Involved:
Data Preprocessing: The images were preprocessed (resized, normalized) before feeding them into the model. The annotations, including the bounding boxes and traffic sign labels, were organized in YOLO format.
Model Training: The YOLOv8 model was fine-tuned on the dataset to optimize detection accuracy. Techniques such as data augmentation were used to improve the modelâ€™s robustness to different lighting conditions and viewpoints.
Evaluation: The trained model was evaluated using metrics such as mean Average Precision (mAP), precision, recall, and F1-score to measure its detection accuracy.
## 5. Challenges:
One of the challenges in traffic sign detection is the variation in size, orientation, and lighting conditions of signs across different images. Additionally, some signs are partially occluded, which adds complexity to the detection task.
To address this, data augmentation techniques (e.g., flipping, random cropping, brightness changes) were applied to make the model more robust to these variations.
## 6. Results:
The trained YOLOv8 model achieved high accuracy in detecting and classifying traffic signs. It performed well in real-time scenarios with a high detection rate, making it suitable for applications like autonomous vehicles.
The model is capable of detecting multiple traffic signs in a single image, even in cases where signs are partially obstructed or seen from different angles.
## 7. Future Improvements:
In the future, I plan to explore fine-tuning the model with more diverse datasets, such as traffic signs from different countries or regions.
Additional techniques like model pruning or quantization could be applied to make the model even faster for real-time detection on low-power devices (e.g., mobile or embedded systems).
Integration with real-time video feeds from cameras for autonomous driving applications.
